H1,Violent crime shows stronger seasonal variation than property crime,Summer months show elevated incident counts; violent crimes may be more weather-dependent,Compare coefficient of variation by month across offense categories,Monthly counts by offense category
H2,Certain districts have disproportionate violent crime rates relative to total incidents,District analysis shows varying offense mix patterns,Chi-square test for district-offense independence; standardized residuals,District × Offense cross-tabulation
H3,Weekend crime patterns differ significantly from weekday patterns in timing,Hourly distributions may shift on weekends due to different activity patterns,Compare weekend vs weekday hourly distributions using KS test,Hourly counts by day type
H4,Long-term crime trends vary by offense category,Different crime types may respond differently to social/economic factors,Separate trend analysis (linear regression) by offense category,Annual counts by offense category
H5,Geographic clustering of crime types exists beyond random distribution,Certain offense types may concentrate in specific areas,Spatial autocorrelation (Moran I) by offense category,Geocoded incidents by offense type
H6,Temporal patterns differ significantly between high-volume and low-volume districts,Districts with different baseline activity may have different temporal rhythms,Compare hourly patterns between top 5 and bottom 5 districts,Hourly counts by district
H7,Missing coordinate patterns are non-random and correlate with offense type,Certain crimes may be more likely to have missing location data,Chi-square test: missing coords vs offense type,Missing coordinate indicator by offense type
H8,Seasonal patterns have remained stable over the 20-year period,"Fundamental seasonal drivers (weather, holidays) should be consistent",Compare monthly distributions across decade (2006-2015 vs 2016-2025),Monthly counts by year group
H9,Peak crime hours vary by offense category,Different crimes may occur at different times of day,Compare peak hours across offense categories,Hourly distribution by offense category
H10,Reporting lag varies by offense severity,More serious crimes may be reported faster than minor incidents,Analyze dispatch_date vs report_date lag by offense category,Date fields by offense category
