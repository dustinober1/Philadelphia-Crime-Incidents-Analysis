    "Severe class imbalance (~9.5% violent) can cause models to under-predict the minority class unless explicitly calibrated/weighted.",

    "Use for aggregate planning and resource allocation, not individual profiling.",
    "Monitor minority-class metrics (violent precision/recall) and calibrate thresholds.",
    "Consider class-weighting, resampling, or threshold tuning if violent recall is low.",
    "Re-evaluate performance quarterly and after major policy or reporting changes."
