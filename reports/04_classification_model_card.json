  "limitations": [
    "Severe class imbalance (~9.5% violent) can cause models to under-predict the minority class unless explicitly calibrated/weighted.",
    "Current default thresholding produced near-zero minority-class recall in this run; threshold tuning, class weights, or resampling is recommended before operational use.",
    "Geographic coverage limited to Philadelphia; performance may not generalize to other cities.",
    "Temporal drift is likely; retraining and monitoring should be performed on a regular cadence.",

    "Re-evaluate performance quarterly and after major policy or reporting changes."
