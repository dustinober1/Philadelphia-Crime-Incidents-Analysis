## Key Findings

### 1. COVID-19 Impact on Crime Composition
The violent crime ratio **increased** during 2020-2021 (11.3%),
likely due to decreased property crime reporting during lockdowns. This does not necessarily mean more violent crime occurred in
absolute terms, but rather that violent crime comprised a larger share of reported incidents.

### 2. Recent Trend
The violent crime ratio is currently **declining**, returning toward pre-pandemic levels.
- Current ratio (2024): 8.4%
- Pre-COVID average (2015-2017): 9.4%

### 3. Volume Context
Total crime volume **decreased** by 9.3%
from 176,768 (2015) to 160,389 (2024).

### 4. Composition Stability
Despite year-to-year fluctuations, the overall composition remains relatively stable:
- Violent crimes consistently represent **8-11%** of total
- Property crimes represent **26-46%** of total

### 5. Violent Crime Internal Composition
Within violent crimes, **Aggravated Assault** remains the dominant category,
accounting for ~55% of all violent crimes.
