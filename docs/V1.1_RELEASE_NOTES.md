# v1.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 2026
**Milestone:** Script-Based Refactor Complete

## Overview

v1.1 represents a complete architectural transformation from notebook-based
to script-based analysis workflow. All 13 analyses are now available as
CLI commands with comprehensive testing, configuration management, and
publication-quality visualization.

## What's New

### CLI Commands (13 Total)

**Chief (3 commands):**
- `trends` - Annual crime trends analysis
- `seasonality` - Seasonal patterns and summer spike
- `covid` - Pre/during/post COVID comparison

**Patrol (4 commands):**
- `hotspots` - Spatial clustering analysis
- `robbery-heatmap` - Temporal heatmap for robbery
- `district-severity` - Per-district severity scoring
- `census-rates` - Population-normalized crime rates

**Policy (4 commands):**
- `retail-theft` - Retail theft trend analysis
- `vehicle-crimes` - Vehicle crime corridor analysis
- `composition` - Crime composition breakdown
- `events` - Event-day impact analysis

**Forecasting (2 commands):**
- `time-series` - Prophet-based time series forecasting
- `classification` - Violence classification with feature importance

### Architecture Improvements

- **Module-based structure:** Reusable utilities in `analysis/utils/` and `analysis/data/`
- **Configuration system:** YAML configs with CLI argument overrides via pydantic
- **Testing framework:** 220+ tests with 90%+ coverage
- **Visualization utilities:** Multi-format output (PNG, SVG, PDF) with consistent styling
- **Rich progress bars:** Beautiful console output for long-running operations

### Quality Improvements

- **Type hints:** All modules use mypy-compatible type annotations
- **Code formatting:** black (100 char line length) and ruff for linting
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Automated testing, linting, and formatting
- **Documentation:** Module docstrings, CLI --help, migration guide

## Migration from v1.0

All 13 v1.0 notebooks have been migrated to CLI commands:
- Notebooks archived to `reports/v1.0/notebooks/`
- CLI commands provide identical functionality with better testability
- See [docs/MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for complete mapping

## Breaking Changes

- **Invocation:** Changed from `jupyter notebook` to `python -m analysis.cli`
- **Configuration:** CLI arguments replace notebook cell parameters
- **Output:** Structured directory layout `reports/{version}/{group}/`
- **Notebooks:** No longer maintained (archived to `reports/v1.0/notebooks/`)

## Quickstart

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate crime

# Run any analysis
python -m analysis.cli chief trends --fast

# See all commands
python -m analysis.cli --help

# Run tests
