# Philadelphia Crime Incidents EDA

## What This Is

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of crime incidents in Philadelphia. This project will analyze all crime categories in the dataset, identify patterns, trends, and insights through data visualization and statistical analysis, producing a markdown report with programmatic visualizations.

## Core Value

Understanding the patterns and trends in Philadelphia crime data to reveal actionable insights about crime distribution, frequency, and characteristics across all crime categories.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped and confirmed valuable. -->

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] Comprehensive data exploration across all crime categories
- [ ] Statistical summaries and descriptive analytics
- [ ] Time-based trend analysis (seasonal, monthly, daily patterns)
- [ ] Geographic distribution analysis
- [ ] Crime type frequency and correlation analysis
- [ ] Data quality assessment and cleaning

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- Predictive modeling - This is focused on exploration, not prediction
- Real-time data processing - Analysis of historical data only
- External data integration - Focusing solely on crime incidents dataset

## Context

This project builds on existing crime incident data for Philadelphia. The analysis will reveal patterns in criminal activity across different dimensions including time, geography, and crime type. The findings will be presented in a markdown report with embedded visualizations generated programmatically.

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: Complete initial EDA within reasonable timeframe
- **Format**: Output must be in markdown format with embedded visualizations
- **Scope**: Focus on descriptive analysis, not predictive modeling
- **Data**: Limited to available crime incidents dataset

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Markdown report format | Simple, portable, version-controllable format | — Pending |
| Programmatic visualizations | Reproducible analysis that can be rerun | — Pending |
| All crime categories | Comprehensive coverage for complete picture | — Pending |
