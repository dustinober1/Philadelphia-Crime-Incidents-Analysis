# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone transition
Plan: —
Status: Milestone v1.1 archived and tagged
Last activity: February 7, 2026 — Completed milestone archival workflow for v1.1

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated February 7, 2026)

**Core value:** One `docker compose up` command reliably brings up the complete stack locally with small, resource-constrained containers.
**Current focus:** Start next milestone definition with `$gsd-new-milestone`

## Milestone Snapshot

- **Milestones:** `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
- **Roadmap archives:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
- **Requirements archives:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.planning/milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Config:** `.planning/config.json`

## Notes

- Milestone v1.1 audit status: passed (`.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`).
- Active milestone requirements file intentionally removed as part of archive workflow.
- Next milestone should begin by defining fresh requirements.
