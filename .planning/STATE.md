# Project State

## Current Status

- **Current phase:** Phase 3 complete
- **Next action:** Audit milestone completion (`$gsd-audit-milestone`)
- **Roadmap coverage:** 12/12 v1 requirements mapped

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated February 7, 2026)

**Core value:** One `docker compose up` command reliably brings up the complete stack locally with small, resource-constrained containers.
**Current focus:** Milestone wrap-up and audit

## Milestone Snapshot

- **Requirements file:** `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Roadmap file:** `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- **Research summary:** `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md`
- **Config:** `.planning/config.json`

## Notes

- Scope is explicitly local-hosting only.
- Cloud deployment concerns are out of scope for this milestone.
- Phase execution should preserve existing brownfield capabilities while improving local container operation.
- Phase 1 verification report: `.planning/phases/01-local-compose-baseline/01-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Phase 2 verification report: `.planning/phases/02-footprint-and-runtime-optimization/02-VERIFICATION.md`.
- Phase 3 verification report: `.planning/phases/03-developer-ux-and-operational-reliability/03-VERIFICATION.md`.
