# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 6 (complete)
Plan: —
Status: Phase 6 complete and verified
Last activity: February 7, 2026 — Executed and verified Phase 6 preset/regression guardrail plans

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated February 7, 2026)

**Core value:** One `docker compose up` command reliably brings up the complete stack locally with small, resource-constrained containers.
**Current focus:** Run milestone audit for v1.1 completion (`$gsd-audit-milestone`)

## Milestone Snapshot

- **Milestones:** `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
- **Roadmap archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- **Requirements archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Config:** `.planning/config.json`

## Notes

- No milestone audit file was found for v1.0; archive completed with accepted audit debt.
- Scope remains local-hosting only until next milestone changes that boundary.
- Phase execution records remain in `.planning/phases/` as historical implementation detail.
