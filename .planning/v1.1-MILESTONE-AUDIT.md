# Milestone Audit: v1.1 Local Workflow Enhancements

## Scope
- Milestone: `v1.1`
- In-scope phases: `04-smoke-check-productization`, `05-runtime-preset-modes`, `06-preset-and-regression-guardrails`
- Definition of done source: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Requirement source: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Phase Verification Coverage

| Phase | Verification File | Status | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 04 Smoke-Check Productization | `.planning/phases/04-smoke-check-productization/04-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 9/9 | Canonical smoke-check workflow and strict readiness/export gates verified |
| 05 Runtime Preset Modes | `.planning/phases/05-runtime-preset-modes/05-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 8/8 | Low-power/high-performance presets and default safety validated |
| 06 Preset and Regression Guardrails | `.planning/phases/06-preset-and-regression-guardrails/06-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 4/4 | Canonical guardrail command and regression coverage verified |

Unverified phases in scope: none.

## Integration and E2E Flow Audit

Integration checker subagent was not available in this runtime. Equivalent integration validation was executed directly with repository tests and wiring checks.

### Cross-Phase Wiring Checks
- `tests/integration/test_phase4_smoke_check_productization.py`
- `tests/integration/test_phase5_runtime_preset_modes.py`
- `tests/integration/test_phase6_preset_regression_guardrails.py`
- Result: `10 passed`

### Documentation/Command Contract Wiring
- Verified canonical and connected commands in both operator docs (`README.md`, `docs/local-compose.md`):
  - `docker compose up -d --build`
  - `python scripts/validate_local_stack.py --skip-startup`
  - `./scripts/compose_with_runtime_mode.sh --mode low-power up -d --build`
  - `./scripts/compose_with_runtime_mode.sh --mode high-performance up -d --build`
  - `make check-runtime-guardrails`

### End-to-End Flows

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Default startup -> smoke check -> use | satisfied | Phase 4 verification + integration tests + docs contract checks |
| Optional runtime mode startup (low/high) while preserving default path | satisfied | Phase 5 verification + integration tests + docs contract checks |
| Runtime guardrail execution for preset/default regression safety | satisfied | Phase 6 verification + integration tests + `make check-runtime-guardrails` documentation |

## Requirement Coverage

| Requirement | Owning Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMOKE-01 | 04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification + validator test coverage |
| SMOKE-02 | 04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification readiness checks (`ok=true`) |
| SMOKE-03 | 04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification web endpoint pass/fail checks |
| SMOKE-04 | 04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification missing export failure behavior |
| SMOKE-05 | 04 | satisfied | Phase 04 verification doc workflow placement |
| PRESET-01 | 05 | satisfied | Phase 05 verification preset template + renderer checks |
| PRESET-02 | 05 | satisfied | Phase 05 verification preset template + renderer checks |
| PRESET-03 | 05 | satisfied | Phase 05 verification default command/path unchanged |
| PRESET-04 | 06 | satisfied | Phase 06 verification guardrail automation + traceability |

Requirements summary: 9/9 satisfied, 0 partial, 0 unsatisfied.

## Tech Debt and Deferred Items
- Critical gaps: none.
- Non-critical deferred items: none found in phase verification artifacts.
- Anti-pattern markers (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `stub`, `placeholder`) in scope artifacts: none.

## Audit Decision
`passed`

Milestone v1.1 achieved its definition of done with full requirements coverage, complete phase verification, and validated cross-phase wiring/e2e flows.
