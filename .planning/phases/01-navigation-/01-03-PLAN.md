  truths:
    - User can open the About page and quickly understand data sources, methodology, and limitations.
    - About content is structured for scanability on mobile and desktop, not presented as an unstructured text block.
    - About metadata and loading state remain consistent with the improved page information architecture.

Purpose: Fully satisfy NAV-04 and ensure the new navigation shell lands users on high-quality explanatory content.
Output: Revised About route content structure, matching route metadata, and improved loading presentation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure About page into clear methodology and limitations sections</name>
  <files>web/src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Rewrite the About page content structure with clear headings and grouped sections: data sources, methodology overview, known limitations/caveats, and contact/attribution. Keep factual content grounded in existing project data context and avoid marketing-style copy. Ensure reading flow remains strong on small screens.</action>
  <verify>cd web && npm run lint</verify>
  <done>About page exposes explicit methodology and limitations sections that are easy to scan and understand.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update About route metadata to match the structured content</name>
  <files>web/src/app/about/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>Align About route metadata (title/description/open graph summary) with the updated sectioned page content so route previews and SEO metadata accurately communicate methodology and limitations transparency.</action>
  <verify>cd web && npm run typecheck</verify>
  <done>About metadata reflects the revised content purpose and remains valid under TypeScript checks.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Polish About loading state for readability and consistency</name>
  <files>web/src/app/about/loading.tsx</files>
  <action>Improve the About loading UI so it aligns with the updated visual shell and remains legible on mobile. Keep implementation lightweight and avoid introducing heavy animation patterns.</action>
  <verify>cd web && npm run build</verify>
  <done>About loading fallback is visually coherent with the page and does not introduce build/runtime errors.</done>

<verification>
- Run `cd web && npm run lint`.
- Run `cd web && npm run typecheck`.
- Run `cd web && npm run build`.
- Manual QA: navigate to `/about` from header on desktop and mobile widths, confirm sectioned content readability and presence of methodology + limitations information.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- About page clearly documents methodology and data limitations (NAV-04).
- Content hierarchy is readable and scannable across viewport sizes.
- Route metadata/loading are aligned with final About page content.
</success_criteria>
