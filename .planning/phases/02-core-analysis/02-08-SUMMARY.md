# Plan 02-08 Summary: Create Missing Geographic Analysis Summary (Gap Closure)

## Overview
This gap closure plan addresses the missing summary file for plan 02-03 (geographic analysis) identified during verification. The geographic analysis itself was completed successfully with all required outputs generated, but the summary documentation was missing.

## Gap Being Closed
- **Issue**: Plan 02-03 had no corresponding summary file
- **Impact**: Incomplete documentation of completed geographic analysis work
- **Root Cause**: Summary file was never created after the analysis was completed

## Actions Taken
1. Reviewed the completed geographic analysis notebook (notebooks/04_geographic_analysis.ipynb)
2. Verified that all required outputs were generated:
   - 6+ figures in output/figures/geographic/
   - district_profiles.csv in output/tables/geographic/
   - hotspot_coordinates.csv in output/tables/geographic/
3. Created comprehensive summary documenting the completed work
4. Verified that GEO-01 through GEO-07 requirements were satisfied by the analysis

## Outcomes Achieved
- Created 02-03-SUMMARY.md documenting the completed geographic analysis
- Verified all output files exist and are properly generated
- Confirmed all GEO requirements (GEO-01 to GEO-07) were addressed
- Documented key findings from KDE heatmaps, district profiles, and hotspot analysis
- Closed documentation gap while preserving completed work

## Verification
- Summary file created and properly formatted
- All geographic analysis outputs confirmed as existing
- Requirements mapping verified as complete
- Gap identified in verification report is now resolved
