<objective>
Create the missing summary file for geographic analysis (plan 02-03) that describes the completed work in notebook 04_geographic_analysis.ipynb and verifies that all required outputs were generated.

Purpose: Complete the geographic analysis documentation by creating the missing summary that addresses GEO-01 through GEO-07 requirements.
Output: 02-03-SUMMARY.md file documenting the completed geographic analysis.

    Create the missing summary file for plan 02-03 (geographic analysis) that documents the completed work:
    
    1. Review the completed notebook 04_geographic_analysis.ipynb and output files
    2. Document the key findings from the geographic analysis:
       - Data preparation and projection to EPSG:2272
       - District-level statistics and profiles
       - KDE heatmaps for overall, violent, and property crimes
       - Hexbin density plot for full dataset
       - Hotspot identification with stability validation
       - Sensitivity analysis with different sample sizes
    
    3. Verify that all output files were generated:
       - 6+ figures in output/figures/geographic/
       - district_profiles.csv in output/tables/geographic/
       - hotspot_coordinates.csv in output/tables/geographic/
    
    4. Confirm that GEO-01 through GEO-07 requirements were addressed
    
    5. Include key metrics and statistics from the analysis
