<objective>
Integrate and validate all forecasting and predictive modeling artifacts, ensuring all requirements (FORECAST-01, FORECAST-02, HYP-HEAT) are satisfied and all artifacts are properly exported to reports/ directory.

Purpose: Validate that all Phase 4 deliverables meet requirements and are properly documented
Output: Validated models with all required artifacts, performance metrics, and summary documentation
