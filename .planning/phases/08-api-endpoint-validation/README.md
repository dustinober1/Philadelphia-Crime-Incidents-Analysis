# Phase 8: Additional API Endpoint Validation

## Goal
Enhance validation beyond basic health checks to verify critical functionality of API endpoints.

## Requirements
- LWF-04-1: Developer can run extended smoke checks that validate specific high-value API endpoints
- LWF-04-2: System validates crime dataset endpoints return expected data structures
- LWF-04-3: API validation includes response time thresholds for performance verification
- LWF-04-4: Extended validation includes data integrity checks for recently processed datasets

## Status
