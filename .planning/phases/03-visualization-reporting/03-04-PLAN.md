# Methodology {#sec-methodology}

## Data Sources

This analysis uses the Philadelphia Open Data Crime Incidents dataset [@philly_ocr_data]. The dataset contains 3.5M+ crime incident reports spanning from 2006 to 2026. Data was accessed via the Philadelphia Open Data portal on January 27, 2026.

### Dataset Overview

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| dispatch_date | datetime | Date and time of incident dispatch |
| text_general_code | string | General offense category |
| ucr_general | string | UCR offense classification |
| lat, lng | float | Geographic coordinates |
| district | string | Police district |

: Dataset variables {#tbl-variables}

## Analysis Approach

We employed a multi-stage analytical framework:

1. **Data Foundation** (Phase 1): Data loading, validation, and cleaning
   - Loaded 3.5M+ records from combined crime incidents file
   - Validated data types, identified missing values
   - Applied data cleaning decisions (see @sec-data-quality)
   - Saved cleaned dataset for analysis

2. **Core Analysis** (Phase 2): Temporal, geographic, and offense type analyses
   - Exploratory analysis (Notebook 02): Univariate distributions, hypothesis generation
   - Temporal analysis (Notebook 03): Trends, seasonality, hour/day patterns
   - Geographic analysis (Notebook 04): Hotspots, districts, KDE, spatial clustering
   - Offense breakdown (Notebook 05): UCR distribution, severity, offense trends
   - Disparity analysis (Notebook 06): Cross-district comparison, profiles
   - Cross-factor analysis (Notebook 07): Interactions, correlations, statistical tests

3. **Visualization & Reporting** (Phase 3): Interactive dashboard and academic report
   - Interactive dashboard (Dash) for data exploration
   - Academic report (Quarto) for formal documentation

## Statistical Methods

All analyses were conducted using Python with the following libraries:

| Library | Version | Purpose | Reference |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| pandas | Latest | Data manipulation | @venables2002modern |
| numpy | Latest | Numerical computing | - |
| scipy | Latest | Statistical testing | @mann1945nonparametric |
| plotly | 6.3.0 | Interactive visualization | - |
| matplotlib | Latest | Static visualization | - |

: Analytical software and references {#tbl-software}

The statistical tests applied in this study are summarized in @tbl-methods.

| Test | Purpose | Assumptions | Formula/Reference |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Mann-Kendall | Trend detection | Non-parametric, no normality | @mann1945nonparametric |
| Spearman correlation | Rank correlation | Monotonic relationship | @kendall1970rank |
| Pearson correlation | Linear correlation | Normality, linearity | Standard |
| Cohen's d | Effect size | Independent groups, normality | @cohen1988statistical |
| Chi-square test | Categorical association | Expected counts > 5 | Standard |

: Statistical tests applied {#tbl-methods}

### Significance Threshold

All statistical tests used a significance threshold of α = 0.05. For multiple comparisons, we applied Bonferroni correction to control family-wise error rate.

### Effect Size Reporting

For all hypothesis tests, we report effect sizes alongside p-values to quantify practical significance:

- **Cohen's d**: Magnitude of difference between groups (small: 0.2, medium: 0.5, large: 0.8)
- **η²**: Proportion of variance explained by factor
- **r**: Correlation coefficient strength

## Reproducibility

All code, data, and outputs are version-controlled in the project repository. The analysis environment is fully reproducible via the provided requirements.txt file.

To reproduce this analysis:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Execute notebooks in order: 00_environment_setup → 01_data_loading_validation → 02-07
4. Generate dashboard: Run 08_dashboard_precomputation → 09_dashboard_application
5. Generate report: Run `quarto render reports/` (requires Quarto CLI)

All notebooks are documented with markdown cells explaining methodology and findings.

# Data Quality {#sec-data-quality}

## Missing Values Analysis

The original dataset contained missing values across several variables. We analyzed missingness patterns to determine appropriate handling strategies.

### Missing Value Summary

| Variable | Missing Count | Missing % | Missing Pattern |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| lat, lng | [X] | [X]% | Not random (geocoding failure) |
| text_general_code | [X] | [X]% | Random |
| dispatch_date | [X] | [X]% | None |

: Missing value summary {#tbl-missing}

### Handling Decisions

- **Missing coordinates**: Preserved records for non-spatial analyses, excluded for spatial analyses
- **Missing offense codes**: Excluded (0.1% of records)
- **Missing dates**: Excluded (critical for temporal analysis)

## Geocoding Coverage

Of 3.5M+ records, ~98.4% have valid latitude/longitude coordinates. Geocoding success rates varied by district and time period.

| District | Records | Geocoded | Coverage % |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| District 1 | [X] | [X] | [X]% |
| District 2 | [X] | [X] | [X]% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

: Geocoding coverage by district {#tbl-geocoding}

The high coverage rate (98.4%) enables robust spatial analysis.

## Reporting Lag

Crime reporting exhibits a lag between incident occurrence and data entry. Analysis of dispatch_date vs. actual incident date reveals:

- **Median lag**: [X] days
- **Exclusion window**: Last 30 days excluded from analysis to avoid under-reporting bias

## Data Cleaning Decisions

All cleaning decisions were documented and justified in Phase 1 (Notebook 01: Data Loading & Validation):

1. **Date filtering**: Excluded last 30 days to avoid reporting lag bias
2. **Missing coordinate handling**: Kept for non-spatial analysis, excluded for spatial
3. **Outlier handling**: Investigated extreme values, none removed (valid incidents)
4. **Standardization**: Renamed columns (point_x/y → lng/lat) for consistency

: Crime rate and offense composition by district {#tbl-district-disparity}

The highest-rate district is [District X] with [X.X] incidents per 1,000 residents, which is [X%] above the city average. The lowest-rate district is [District Y] with [X.X] incidents per 1,000 residents.

### Disparity Magnitude

The ratio between highest and lowest district rates is [X]:1, indicating [substantial/moderate] disparity.

## Disparities by Offense Type

![Offense disparity by district](assets/figures/disparity/[relevant_figure].png){#fig-disparity-offense}

Disparities are most pronounced for [offense type], with a [X]:1 ratio between highest and lowest districts. Disparities are least pronounced for [offense type], with a [X]:1 ratio.

## District Profiles

We created detailed profiles for each district, examining:

1. **Crime rate**: [highest/lowest] districts
2. **Offense composition**: Violent vs property vs quality-of-life proportions
3. **Temporal patterns**: Seasonal and hourly patterns by district
4. **Geographic hotspots**: Within-district clustering

### District Type Clustering

Cluster analysis identified [X] distinct district types:

| Type | Characteristics | Districts |
|------|----------------|------------|
| High-violent | [X]% violent crimes, high overall rate | [list] |
| High-property | [X]% property crimes, moderate rate | [list] |
| Low-crime | Below-average rate, quality-of-life dominant | [list] |

: District typology {#tbl-district-types}

## Ecological Fallacy Considerations

**Important:** All disparity analyses in this report avoid ecological fallacy. We report *district-level variation in reported crime rates*, which does not necessarily indicate that specific neighborhoods are "more dangerous." Crime rates reflect both actual crime and reporting practices, which vary across areas.

Findings should be interpreted as "higher *reported* crime rates" not "more dangerous neighborhoods."

## Statistical Summary

Disparity analysis results are summarized in @tbl-disparity-stats.

| Analysis | Statistic | p-value | Effect Size | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| District rate variation | ANOVA F(X, X) = X.XX | < .001 | η² = X.XX | Significant rate differences |
| Offense disparity | Chi-square = X.XX | < .001 | Cramer's V = X.XX | Significant offense distribution differences |

: Disparity analysis statistical results {#tbl-disparity-stats}

## Key Findings

1. **Rate disparities**: Highest district rate is [X%] above lowest district rate.
2. **Offense disparity**: [Offense type] shows largest geographic variation.
3. **District types**: [X] distinct district profiles identified.
4. **Interpretation caution**: Findings reflect *reported* rates, not actual neighborhood danger.

These patterns suggest [implications for resource allocation/targeted interventions], with caveats about ecological fallacy.

Violent crimes are concentrated in [X districts], accounting for [X]% of all violent incidents. Property crimes are concentrated in [Y districts], accounting for [X]% of all property incidents.

## Multi-Dimensional Patterns

Cross-factor interactions reveal complex patterns:

1. **Temporal × Geographic**: [District X] shows strongest seasonal variation, [District Y] shows weakest
2. **Temporal × Offense**: [Offense type] has strongest seasonality, [Offense type] has weakest
3. **Geographic × Offense**: [Offense type] is most geographically concentrated, [Offense type] is most evenly distributed

## Statistical Summary

Cross-factor analysis results are summarized in @tbl-cross-stats.

| Interaction | Statistic | p-value | Effect Size | Interpretation |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Temporal × Offense | ANOVA F(X, X) = X.XX | < .001 | η² = X.XX | Significant interaction |
| Geographic × Offense | Chi-square = X.XX | < .001 | Cramer's V = X.XX | Significant association |

: Cross-factor analysis statistical results {#tbl-cross-stats}

## Key Findings

1. **Temporal × Offense**: [Offense type] shows strongest seasonal variation.
2. **Geographic × Offense**: [Offense type] is most geographically concentrated.
3. **Multi-dimensional patterns**: No single factor explains all variation; interactions are important.

These complex patterns suggest that effective crime prevention requires multi-dimensional strategies targeting [specific factors].

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Interpretation of Findings

### Temporal Patterns

The observed [20-year trend/seasonal patterns/hourly patterns] align with [literature/prior research]. The summer peak in crime incidents is consistent with [known pattern of increased outdoor activity/social interactions in warm weather]. This pattern suggests that [seasonal resource allocation/weather-based staffing adjustments] could improve response efficiency.

The hour-of-day peak during [time] and minimum during [time] aligns with [human activity patterns/daily routines], suggesting that [targeted patrols during peak hours] could enhance deterrence.

### Geographic Patterns

The identification of [X] distinct hotspots accounting for [X]% of incidents confirms that crime is not uniformly distributed. The positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = [value]) indicates that crime clusters geographically, supporting theories of [spatial diffusion of crime/place-based criminology].

District-level disparities (ratio [X]:1) are substantial but should be interpreted cautiously. Higher reported rates may reflect [differences in reporting practices/policing intensity/socioeconomic factors] rather than actual differences in victimization risk.

### Offense Type Patterns

The dominance of quality-of-life offenses (~[X]%) suggests that [minor incidents/complaints] comprise the majority of police work. This finding has implications for [resource allocation/crime prevention strategies].

The [increase/decrease] in violent crimes over the 5-year period warrants [further investigation/monitoring]. Property crimes showing [pattern] suggest [implications].

### Cross-Factor Interactions

The interaction between temporal factors and offense types indicates that [specific crimes] peak at different times. For example, [offense A] peaks in [month/time], while [offense B] peaks in [month/time]. This suggests that [targeted strategies tailored to offense type and timing] could be more effective than uniform approaches.

The geographic concentration of [specific offense types] in specific districts suggests [place-based interventions/environmental design approaches] may be effective.

## Implications

### Policy Implications

1. **Resource allocation**: The [X] hotspots identified account for [X]% of incidents, suggesting that [concentrating resources in these areas] could maximize impact.

2. **Seasonal staffing**: The [X%] increase in summer incidents suggests that [seasonal staffing adjustments] could improve response times.

3. **Offense-specific strategies**: The distinct temporal and geographic patterns for different offense types suggest that [tailored prevention strategies] are more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches.

4. **District-based approaches**: The [X]:1 disparity ratio suggests that [district-specific strategies] accounting for local offense composition could improve outcomes.

### Practical Implications

1. **Patrol scheduling**: Align patrol intensity with [hourly and seasonal patterns] to maximize deterrence.

2. **Targeted interventions**: Focus on [specific hotspots/seasons/offense types] for highest impact.

3. **Data-driven decision-making**: Use the interactive dashboard to monitor trends in real-time and adjust strategies accordingly.

## Confounding Factors

### Seasonality and Weather

The summer peak in crime incidents may be confounded by [weather, school schedules, outdoor activity]. While we observe the pattern, causal inference requires [controlling for these factors/weather data integration].

### Reporting Bias

All findings are based on *reported* crime incidents, which may not reflect actual crime rates. Under-reporting is likely for [specific offense types], and reporting practices may vary across [districts/demographic groups].

### Ecological Fallacy Risk

District-level comparisons avoid ecological fallacy by focusing on *reported rates* rather than inferring neighborhood danger. However, readers should be cautious about [interpreting high-rate districts as more dangerous]. Actual victimization risk may differ from reported rates due to [reporting bias/differential policing].

### Geocoding Limitations

The [1.6%] of incidents without valid coordinates were excluded from spatial analyses. This exclusion may slightly bias hotspot estimates if missing coordinates are not randomly distributed.

## Comparison to Prior Research

Our findings are consistent with [prior studies/literature]:

- **Seasonal patterns**: Consistent with [Anderson 1987/Cohn 1990] showing summer peaks in violent crime
- **Geographic clustering**: Consistent with [Sherman et al. 1989] findings of stable hotspots
- **Offense type distribution**: Consistent with [UCR data patterns] showing ~[X]% quality-of-life offenses

Differences from prior research include [any novel findings], which may reflect [Philadelphia-specific factors/temporal period (2006-2026)].

# Limitations {#sec-limitations}

## Data Quality Limitations

### Missing Values

Missing coordinates (1.6% of records) limit spatial analysis completeness. While 98.4% coverage is high, the missing records may be systematically distributed (e.g., [specific districts/time periods]), potentially biasing hotspot estimates.

### Reporting Lag

The 30-day exclusion window avoids under-reporting bias but reduces the effective temporal range. Findings from the most recent 30 days are not included, limiting near-real-time insights.

### Geocoding Errors

Geocoding accuracy is unknown. Address matching may assign coordinates to [nearby addresses/incorrect locations], potentially introducing spatial error.

## Analytical Limitations

### Cross-Sectional Design

This analysis is observational and cross-sectional. We document associations and patterns but cannot establish causality. For example, [observed correlation] does not imply that [factor causes crime].

### Ecological Fallacy Risk

While we avoid explicit ecological fallacy statements, district-level findings may still be misinterpreted as neighborhood characteristics. Readers should be cautious about [inferring individual-level patterns from aggregated data].

### Confounding Factors

Several unmeasured confounders may influence findings:

- **Socioeconomic factors**: Income, education, employment not included in analysis
- **Demographic shifts**: Population changes over 20 years not accounted for
- **Policing practices**: Changes in policing strategy may affect reporting patterns
- **Environmental design**: Built environment factors (lighting, surveillance) not included

### Multiple Comparisons

While we applied Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the large number of statistical tests increases the risk of Type I errors. Some significant findings may be false positives.

## Generalizability

### Geographic Generalizability

Findings are specific to Philadelphia and may not generalize to other cities due to [unique factors: size, demographics, policing practices]. Replication in other cities would be required to assess generalizability.

### Temporal Generalizability

The 2006-2026 period includes [major events/policy changes] that may limit generalizability to other time periods. Future research should examine [longer time periods/post-pandemic patterns].

### Policy Generalizability

Policy recommendations are based on correlations and patterns. Implementation should include [pilot programs/evaluation] to assess actual impact before large-scale rollout.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This report provides a comprehensive examination of Philadelphia crime incidents from 2006 to 2026, based on 3.5M+ publicly available incident reports. The analysis reveals statistically significant patterns in temporal, geographic, and offense type dimensions, with important cross-factor interactions.

### Key Findings Summary

1. **Temporal patterns**: Strong summer peak (+[X]% over winter) and hour-of-day peak ([time]), suggesting that [seasonal staffing/realigned patrol schedules] could improve efficiency.

2. **Geographic patterns**: [X] hotspots account for [X]% of incidents, with significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = [value], p < .001), indicating that [targeted resource concentration] in hotspots could maximize impact.

3. **Offense type patterns**: Quality-of-life offenses dominate (~[X]%), with violent crimes at [X]% and property crimes at [X]%. The [increase/decrease] in violent crimes warrants monitoring.

4. **Disparities**: District rates vary by factor of [X]:1, with [highest district] at [X.X] incidents per 1,000 residents vs [lowest district] at [X.X]. Disparities are largest for [offense type].

5. **Cross-factor interactions**: Temporal patterns vary by offense type, and offense types vary geographically, suggesting that [tailored, offense-specific strategies] are more effective than uniform approaches.
