# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

Audit performed: 2026-02-04T00:30:00Z

Executive summary
- Status: tech_debt — all requirements satisfied and all phases verified; no critical blockers found.
- Requirements: 14/14 satisfied.
- Phases checked: 4/4 (Phases 01–04). Each phase has at least one SUMMARY or VERIFICATION artifact; Phase 4 re-verification is present and passed.
- Integration: repository wiring is generally solid; no missing critical artifacts. Two medium-severity integration issues (filename mismatch and JSON schema drift) and two low-severity documentation/traceability items remain.

Key counts
- Requirements satisfied: 14/14
- Phases verified: 4/4
- Integration severity: critical=0, medium=2, low=2

Detailed findings

1) Requirements coverage
- All v1 requirements mapped to phases and marked Complete in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (FORECAST-01, FORECAST-02, HYP-HEAT included). Verified artifacts exist for Phase 4 per `.planning/phases/04-forecasting-predictive/04-VERIFICATION.md`.

2) Phase verifications
- Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3: SUMMARYs and manifests present; artifacts exported to `reports/` and `data/processed/` as expected.
- Phase 4: VERIFICATION.md reports `status: passed` (6/6 truths verified) after gap-closure plans 04-06 and 04-07. Human verification items (visual checks, schema acceptance) remain recommended.

3) Cross-phase integration and E2E flows (high level)
- Passes: raw → phase1 → reports; phase2 boundary & tract outputs produced; phase3 artifacts produced; phase4 forecasting & classification produce expected artifacts.
- Partial / medium risks:
  - Heat–crime artifact filename mismatch (notebook vs planned filenames) — discoverability and provenance risk.
  - Heat–crime statistical-tests JSON schema divergence — programmatic consumer risk.
- Low / documentation:
  - Phase 2 tract-rate artifacts have no documented downstream consumers — clarify intent or add reads.
  - Classification artifact naming was transiently inconsistent but current repo contains canonical exports; add orchestration validation to prevent regressions.

4) Suggested fixes (short list)
- F1 (medium): Standardize heat–crime artifact filenames in `notebooks/04_hypothesis_heat_crime.ipynb` or add an explicit export/rename cell; update phase manifest.
- F2 (medium): Export statistical tests JSON to canonical schema (fields: test_name, statistic, p_value, effect_size, conclusion, ci_lower, ci_upper) or add `analysis/report_utils.py` adapter + schema test.
- F3 (low): Document consumers of `data/processed/tract_crime_rates.parquet` in phase2 manifest and/or add explicit reads in downstream notebooks.
- F4 (low): Add orchestration validation that required report files (CSV + canonical PNG names) exist after notebook execution; fail the run if missing.

5) Next steps (recommended)
1. Accept milestone with tracked tech debt (recommended when product stakeholders accept schema/name changes): run `/gsd-complete-milestone v1.0`.
2. Or, plan a small cleanup phase to address medium-severity items before completion: create `/gsd-plan-milestone-gaps` to add 1–2 short tasks (standardize filenames + JSON adapter + schema tests + manifest updates).
