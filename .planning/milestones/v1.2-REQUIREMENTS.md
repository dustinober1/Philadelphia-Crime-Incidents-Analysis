# Requirements: Crime Incidents Philadelphia - v1.2 Deferred Workflow Enhancements

**Defined:** February 6, 2026
**Core Value:** One `docker compose up` command reliably brings up the complete stack locally with small, resource-constrained containers.

## v1.2 Requirements

### LWF-03: Machine-Readable Output for Automation

- [x] **LWF-03-1**: Smoke-check validation supports JSON-formatted output for CI parsing. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-03-2**: Validation outputs structured status reports in JSON and YAML formats. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-03-3**: Validation script exit codes reflect validation outcomes. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-03-4**: Machine-readable validation output includes timing information. (validated)

### LWF-04: Additional API Endpoint Validation

- [x] **LWF-04-1**: Extended smoke checks validate high-value API endpoints. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-04-2**: Endpoint validation checks expected crime dataset response structures. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-04-3**: Endpoint validation enforces response-time thresholds. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-04-4**: Extended checks include data integrity validation for recent datasets. (validated)

### LWF-05: Host Resource Detection and Smart Presets

- [x] **LWF-05-1**: System detects host CPU and RAM before startup. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-05-2**: Runtime presets can be auto-selected from detected resources. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-05-3**: Developers receive explicit runtime preset recommendations. (validated)
- [x] **LWF-05-4**: Detection logic supports Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL environments. (validated)

### Development Workflow Enhancements (Adjusted)

- [x] **DWE-01**: Documentation coverage for LWF-03/LWF-04/LWF-05 delivered via README and docs updates. (validated)
- [x] **DWE-02**: Command interface expanded with `--format`, `--extended`, `--mode auto`, and `--recommend`. (validated)
- [ ] **DWE-03**: Standardized actionable error-message improvements across all developer workflows. (deferred)
- [ ] **DWE-04**: Full configuration consistency validation across all preset modes. (deferred)

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

- [ ] Advanced metrics export in Prometheus format
- [ ] Real-time event streaming for long-running operations
- [ ] Full API contract validation against OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Historical data validation across multiple time periods
- [ ] Dynamic resource adjustment during runtime
- [ ] Machine learning-based optimization for workload patterns
- [ ] DWE-03 actionable error-message standardization
- [ ] DWE-04 full preset consistency validation

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| XML output format support | JSON/YAML covered current automation use cases |
| External data-source correctness validation | Scope focused on local API structure/integrity checks |
| Automatic resource reallocation without user oversight | User control preserved for local runtime behavior |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LWF-03-1 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| LWF-03-2 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| LWF-03-3 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| LWF-03-4 | Phase 7 | Complete |
| LWF-04-1 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LWF-04-2 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LWF-04-3 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LWF-04-4 | Phase 8 | Complete |
| LWF-05-1 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| LWF-05-2 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| LWF-05-3 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| LWF-05-4 | Phase 9 | Complete |
| DWE-01 | Cross-phase | Complete |
| DWE-02 | Cross-phase | Complete |
| DWE-03 | Cross-phase | Deferred |
| DWE-04 | Cross-phase | Deferred |
