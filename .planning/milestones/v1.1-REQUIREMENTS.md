# Requirements: Crime Incidents Philadelphia - v1.1 Local Workflow Enhancements

**Defined:** February 7, 2026
**Core Value:** One `docker compose up` command reliably brings up the complete stack locally with small, resource-constrained containers.

## v1 Requirements

### Smoke Checks

- [x] **SMOKE-01**: Developer can run one documented post-start smoke-check command that validates a running local compose stack without requiring a restart. (validated)
- [x] **SMOKE-02**: Smoke check verifies API health endpoint reports ready (`ok=true`) before passing. (validated)
- [x] **SMOKE-03**: Smoke check verifies the local web endpoint is reachable and returns a successful HTTP response. (validated)
- [x] **SMOKE-04**: Smoke check fails when API reports missing required exports/artifacts and prints actionable failure details. (validated)
- [x] **SMOKE-05**: Local docs place smoke-check usage in the standard startup workflow (start -> verify -> use). (validated)

### Runtime Presets

- [x] **PRESET-01**: Developer can run a documented low-power runtime mode that applies explicit reduced CPU/memory limits for pipeline, API, and web services. (validated)
- [x] **PRESET-02**: Developer can run a documented high-performance runtime mode that applies explicit increased CPU/memory limits for heavier local analysis workflows. (validated)
- [x] **PRESET-03**: Default startup command (`docker compose up -d --build`) remains unchanged and still uses the documented baseline runtime budget values. (validated)
- [x] **PRESET-04**: Automated validation checks verify both preset render behavior and default-mode regression safety. (validated)

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Local Workflow Enhancements (Deferred)

- [ ] **LWF-03**: Smoke-check script can emit machine-readable structured output for CI and automation consumers. (deferred)
- [ ] **LWF-04**: Smoke-check workflow validates additional high-value API endpoints beyond baseline health/readiness. (deferred)
- [ ] **LWF-05**: Runtime mode can be auto-selected from host resource detection. (deferred)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud deployment/runtime presets | Scope remains local-hosting only |
| New product-facing API/frontend capabilities unrelated to local workflow reliability | Milestone was operational hardening only |
| More than two non-default runtime presets | Complexity deferred until low-power/high-performance split is validated |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SMOKE-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| SMOKE-02 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| SMOKE-03 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| SMOKE-04 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| SMOKE-05 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| PRESET-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| PRESET-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| PRESET-03 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| PRESET-04 | Phase 6 | Complete |
