## Overview

Achieve 95%+ test coverage across Python codebase (analysis/, api/, pipeline/, CLI) and perform comprehensive repository cleanup to establish a clean quality baseline for future development. This milestone follows a tests-first, cleanup-second approach to ensure all code paths are validated before making removal decisions.

2. Dead code identified with vulture and removed after manual review
3. Unused imports removed automatically with autoflake
4. Deprecated content in scripts/, docs/, notebooks/ identified and removed
5. Safety gates prevent accidental removal of active code (git status check, test validation)

**Details:**
- Run pyclean to remove Python artifacts (*.pyc, __pycache__, .coverage)
- Run vulture to identify unused functions and classes (dead code detection)
- Run autoflake to remove unused imports automatically
- Manually review and remove deprecated scripts, documentation, and notebooks
- Implement safety gates: git status check, import validation, test dependency check

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- None planned (may be added via `/gsd-insert-phase` if urgent work discovered)

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Tests-first, cleanup-second approach. Rationale: Validate all code paths before removal decisions. Outcome: TBD.
- Decision: Target 95% coverage (not 100%). Rationale: Optimal quality/effort balance, diminishing returns above 95%. Outcome: TBD.
- Decision: Use mutation testing for quality validation. Rationale: Prevent coverage gaming, ensure tests catch bugs. Outcome: TBD.

**Issues to Address:**

- Preventing coverage gaming (hitting percentages without meaningful assertions)
- Avoiding breaking existing functionality while adding tests
- Ensuring deleted code is truly unused (not just untested)
- Managing test suite performance as coverage grows

**Issues Deferred:**

- UI/E2E tests for Next.js frontend (out of scope for quality milestone)
- Load/stress testing (deferred to future milestone)
- 100% coverage obsession (95% is optimal target)

**Technical Debt Expected:**

- None anticipated if tests focus on behavior through public APIs
