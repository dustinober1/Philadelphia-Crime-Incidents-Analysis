# Milestone v1.2: Deferred Workflow Enhancements

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED February 7, 2026
**Phases:** 7-9
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Delivered deferred local workflow enhancements focused on automation compatibility and runtime adaptivity. This milestone added machine-readable smoke-check outputs, expanded high-value API endpoint validation with integrity/performance checks, and introduced host-aware smart runtime preset recommendations.

## Phases

### Phase 7: Machine-Readable Output for Automation

**Goal**: Enable seamless integration with CI/CD systems and automation tools.
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 07-01: Add machine-readable output, exit codes, and timing metadata to local stack validation

**Details:**
- Added structured validation models and `--format` output modes (`human`, `json`, `yaml`) in `scripts/validate_local_stack.py`.
- Added timing metadata and explicit success/failure exit-code behavior for automation consumers.
- Preserved backward-compatible human output as default.

### Phase 8: Additional API Endpoint Validation

**Goal**: Validate high-value API behavior beyond baseline health checks.
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 08-01: Add extended endpoint, integrity, and performance validation

**Details:**
- Added `--extended` endpoint validation path for high-value API routes.
- Added response integrity validators (`scripts/data_integrity_validators.py`) by endpoint type.
- Added endpoint performance thresholds/utilities (`scripts/performance_thresholds.py`, `scripts/performance_utils.py`).

### Phase 9: Host Resource Detection and Smart Presets

**Goal**: Auto-optimize runtime preset recommendations from host resources.
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 09-01: Add cross-platform resource detection and smart preset wiring

**Details:**
- Added cross-platform resource detection (`scripts/resource_detector.py`) for Linux/macOS/WSL signals.
- Added recommendation engine (`scripts/preset_calculator.py`) with human/json/env outputs.
- Updated compose runtime wrapper with `--mode auto` and `--recommend` support.
- Added docs/tests for resource-aware mode guidance and behavior.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- None

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Keep validation UX backward compatible while adding structured outputs. Outcome: ✓ Good.
- Decision: Expand smoke checks via an opt-in `--extended` mode rather than default broadening. Outcome: ✓ Good.
- Decision: Implement resource-aware recommendation first, with explicit user control retained. Outcome: ✓ Good.

**Issues Resolved:**

- Removed manual parsing friction for CI/CD smoke-check usage.
- Increased confidence in API readiness by validating endpoint structure and response-time thresholds.
- Reduced runtime mode guesswork by exposing host-aware recommendations.

**Issues Deferred:**

- Prometheus metrics export and real-time validation events (deferred to v2 scope).
- OpenAPI contract-level validation and historical multi-period integrity checks (deferred to v2 scope).
- Dynamic runtime adjustment and ML-based optimization (deferred to v2 scope).

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- No critical debt identified in phase verification or milestone audit artifacts.
